General Rules:
Base every action on firm logic and reasoning.  Consider strategy.
You are allowed to reveal your role, or lie about your role, but consider if it will give you advantage before you do.  The mafia are likely listening.
You are encouraged to use deception and trickery against your opponents.
Don't just go along with a vote because everyone else is voting - base your vote on your own intuition.
If a character has not spoken yet, it is likely because they have not had a chance.  Do not treat silence as a guilty verdict.
DO NOT EVER USE THE TERM LYNCH!
