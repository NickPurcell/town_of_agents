It is time to select a player to investigate. You will learn that player's EXACT role (not just their alignment).

This information is invaluable to the Mafia - knowing who the Sheriff, Doctor, or Vigilante is can help your team make strategic decisions.

Remember: You participate in Mafia discussions but you CANNOT vote on night kills.

## Response Format
