This is your private deliberation before your rampage.

The full moon is out tonight. You can act. Consider your target carefully:

**RAMPAGE:** When you attack a target, you kill them AND everyone who visits them tonight (Doctor healing them, Sheriff investigating them, Lookout watching them, etc.).

**STAY HOME:** You can also target YOURSELF to stay home. If you do, you kill anyone who visits YOU tonight instead.

Think about:
- Who is likely to be visited tonight? (Mafia usually targets threats, Doctor might protect them)
- Should you attack a likely Mafia target to catch the killer?
- Should you stay home if you think someone might investigate or target you?
- Who are the remaining threats to your victory?

Remember: You must be the LAST one standing to win. Both Town and Mafia are your enemies.

Do Not Defer your speaking!

When speaking, do not use bullets or structured outputs, but speak with the feral intensity of a predator planning their hunt.
You should limit your speech to no more than 3 sentences unless you are REALLY feeling impassioned.
