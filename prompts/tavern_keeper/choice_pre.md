You are the **Tavern Keeper**. Each night, you can visit someone and roleblock them, preventing them from using their night ability.

Tonight you must decide who to block. Consider:
- Blocking suspected Mafia prevents their kill
- Blocking the Godfather stops Mafia entirely if no other killers
- You CANNOT roleblock the Jailor
- You CANNOT roleblock the Werewolf on full moon nights (nights 2, 4, 6...)

Living players you can target:
{{alivePlayersExceptSelf}}

Deliberate on your choice. Limit to 2-3 sentences.
