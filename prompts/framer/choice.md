It is time to select a player to frame. If the Sheriff investigates them tonight, they will appear suspicious.

Your frame only lasts for this night. At dawn, the frame is cleared.

Remember: You participate in Mafia discussions but you CANNOT vote on night kills.

## Response Format
Respond with JSON:
```json
{
  "type": "choice",
  "target": "PlayerName" or "DEFER"
}

Choose a player's exact name to frame, or "DEFER" to skip.
